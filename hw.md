Here are some presentation of my homework done in different class. Those contents are ordered descending in time. I'm studying in China so you can expect many of the contents are in Chinese, particulaly group project. Only those done individually by myself are mostly in English. 

Homeworks comes in a various of formats due to the class requirements and my mood at the moment, most of which are pdf written in latex or generated by R markdown, with a few being hand written on my iPad. 

 All homework demonstrated here are finished by myself individually if not specified. I'm fully responsible for the commitment to honesty, independence and reproducibility of all those. Although careless typos and stupid mistakes can be found easily on my homework, no violation of academic principles has ever been on them, and they will never be.
