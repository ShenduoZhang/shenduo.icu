Here are some of my homework done in different class. Those contents are ordered in a chronical order. I'm studying in China so you can expect many of the contents are in Chinese, particulaly in group projects. But those written individually by myself are usually in English. 

Homeworks comes in a various of formats due to the class requirements and my mood at the moment, most of which are pdf written in latex or generated by R markdown, with a few being hand written on my iPad. 

All homework demonstrated here were finished by myself and myself only if not specified. **I'm fully responsible for the commitment to honesty, independence and reproducibility of all those. Although careless typos and stupid mistakes can be found easily in my homework, violation of academic principles has never been in them, and they will never be.**

## Statistical consultary 

Lecturer: Xuehu Zhu

Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University

Collaborator: Shaokang Zu

The reports are all in Chinese and the code writen are basically without much comments. But by running the code, you do reproduce what we did. Due to the fact that the class is still in progress, the repository is kept private for now.

- Homework on `generalized linera model` and `asymptotic normality for parameter estimation in parameterized non-linear model`.
  - Report [pdf](https://martyrzsd.github.io/homework/2020/statisticalconsultary/1.pdf)
  - R code, R studio project and RMD notebook [code](https://github.com/martyrzsd/Statistical_Consultary)
