Here are some of my homework done in class. Those contents are chronically ordered. I'm studying in China, so you can expect many of the them are in Chinese, particulaly group projects. But those written individually by myself are usually in English. 

Those material comes in many formats due to class requirements and my mood at the time, most of which are pdf written in latex or generated by R markdown, with a few being hand written on my iPad. Those homeworks' quality are not very stable, depending on my time and attention dedicated to the course.

All homework demonstrated here were finished by myself and myself only if not specified. **I'm fully responsible for the commitment to honesty, independence and reproducibility of all those. Although careless typos and stupid mistakes can be found easily in my homework, violation of academic principles has never been in them, and they will never be.** ***I'm not responsible for any outcomes for usage of those contents, be aware and expected to find mistakes in thoss contents.***  And please understand that those are my personal efforts, I made it free to public as a reward for the support I enjoyed from others across my study. ***NO REDISTRIBUTION IS ALLOWED UNLESS REQUESTED.***

If you have any questions about the material or found any errors, feel free to contact me through email, which you can find at the bottom of this webpage.

# 2017 Fall-2019 Spring

Only the following homeworks are available

- Mathematical analysis (first semester out of three)
- Advanced algebra (first semester out of two)

I was using electronic homeworks at first. However, I switched back to hand-written ones after the first semester. Because the TA in `Mathematical Analysis` gave me an incredible low score on my homework because of the using of electronic homeworks. Comparing to a regular grading to other students, my final score of this class was lower by 5/100, 95 -> 90. When I switched back to hand-written version, I got the same as everyone else did. At the time I didn't argue anything about this, because I literally didn't care about grades whatsoever. When I wanted to make more progress on academia later on and realized how much I lost on my GPA because of this injustice(this was a 96 hours per semester class), it was already too late. The TA in `advanced algebra` didn't donwgrade my homework for this reason. 

Those contents are handwriten in Chinese in [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwg9EKYk2bIJ47jXsFUQ).

However after this I wasn't using electronic homeworks anymore until I went to GaTech. Those homeworks are now basically all lost. SAD.
