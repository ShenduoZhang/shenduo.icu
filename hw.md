Here are some of my homework done in different class. Those contents are ordered in a chronical order. I's studying in China so you can expect many of the contents are in Chinese, particulaly in group projects. But those written individually by myself are usually in English. 

Homeworks comes in a various of formats due to the class requirements and my mood at the moment, most of which are pdf written in latex or generated by R markdown, with a few being hand written on my iPad. Those homeworks' quality are not very stable, mostly depending on my time and attention dedicated to the class.

All homework demonstrated here were finished by myself and myself only if not specified. **I'm fully responsible for the commitment to honesty, independence and reproducibility of all those. Although careless typos and stupid mistakes can be found easily in my homework, violation of academic principles has never been in them, and they will never be.**

And for my those taking the same class, ***take those materials as hints do not copy them.***  And please understand that those are my personal efforts, I made it free to public as a reward for the support I enjoyed from others during my study. ***NO REDISTRIBUTION IS ALLOWED UNLESS REQUESTED.***

If you have any question about the material, please contact me though email, which you can find at the bottom of this webpage.
