Here are some of my homework done in class. Those contents are in a chronical order. I'm studying in China, so you can expect many of the them are in Chinese, particulaly group projects. But those written individually by myself are usually in English. 

Those material comes in a many formats due to class requirements and my mood at the time, most of which are pdf written in latex or generated by R markdown, with a few being hand written on my iPad. Those homeworks' quality are not very stable, depending on my time and attention dedicated to the course.

All homework demonstrated here were finished by myself and myself only if not specified. **I'm fully responsible for the commitment to honesty, independence and reproducibility of all those. Although careless typos and stupid mistakes can be found easily in my homework, violation of academic principles has never been in them, and they will never be.**

And for my those taking the same class, ***please take those materials as hints, do not copy them.***  And please understand that those are my personal efforts, I made it free to public as a reward for the support I enjoyed from others during my study. ***NO REDISTRIBUTION IS ALLOWED UNLESS REQUESTED.***

If you have any question about the material, feel free to contact me through email, which you can find at the bottom of this webpage.
