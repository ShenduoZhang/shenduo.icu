# Shenduo Zhang

I'm a Machine Learning PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, enrolled in 2021 August under School of Mathematics. My research interests are in statistics and machine learning theory, and I am currently working on developing theory for structure detection and extrapolation on graphs with latent geometrical structure.

I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my advisor, Professor [Cheng Mao](https://people.math.gatech.edu/~cmao35/). He has been a great mentor.

I love pets and have adopted two lovely cats. I named them after mathematician, Gauss and Kolmo.

## Push me

I use a private repository to store all my homework tex files. But you can see my commit frequency in the following images. This is an indication of my current homework load.
