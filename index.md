# Welcome to my homepage

I'm a Machine Learning PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, enrolled in 2021 August under the School of Mathematics. My research interests are in statistics, machine learning theory and application. I am currently actively working on structure inference on random graphs with latent geometrical structures.

I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my advisor, Professor [Cheng Mao](https://people.math.gatech.edu/~cmao35/).

<!-- ## Push me

I use a private repository to store all my homework tex files. But you can see my commit frequency in the following images. This is an indication of my current homework load.
