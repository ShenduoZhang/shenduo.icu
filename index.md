# Welcome to my homepage

I'm a Machine Learning PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, enrolled in 2021 August under the School of Mathematics. My research interests are in statistics and machine learning theory. I am currently working on structure inference on random graphs with latent geometrical structures.

I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my advisor, Professor [Cheng Mao](https://people.math.gatech.edu/~cmao35/).

I tried to enjoy some sports to stay healthy and live longer. Mountain bike cycling was the one survived and I'm still improving my overall fitness level to be good at it. Although one lesson I learned was it's questionable that if mountain bike riding can really make one live longer not significantly shorter.

I play various kinds of games as well. Base-building games like [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) and [Oxygen Not Included](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/) are my favorite. I also enjoyed (not anymore) played some e-sport games, like [DotA](https://www.dota2.com/home). I played at a competitive level in DotA at around 7000MMR, which is roughly top 0.5% among the global active players. This journey contributed to my interest of developing a better game matching system. Games helped me to live through some of the hardest time of my life. But now, in the not so hard period of the life, I still play a lot because of addiction. 


<!-- ## Push me

I use a private repository to store all my homework tex files. But you can see my commit frequency in the following images. This is an indication of my current homework load.
