# Shenduo Zhang

I'm a math PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, enrolled in 2021 August. My research interests are concentrated in mathematical statistics. It's my fortune to work with my advisor, Professor [Cheng Mao](https://people.math.gatech.edu/~cmao35/).

我的中文名字是张申铎.

Still nothing yet. But you can check 👉**<font size="6">[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)</font>**👈 amazing and yet easy to understand introduction of what my research is about!

## Push me

I use a private repository to store all my homework tex files. But you can see my commit frequency in the following images. This is an indication of my current homework load.
