This page contains undergraduate classes I've taken and my notes as well as cheat-sheets I made for reviewing. Basically all of them are hand-written digital notes. I never enjoyed any reputation of good calligraphy. Be prepared when you read it. 

- FOR NOTES

  Majority of the notes are taken using *OneNote*, which is a free cross-platform(`Windows`, `macOS`, `iOS`, `Android`, `web`) note taking software developed by `Microsoft`. 

  <!-- - If you are outside China, you can access my notes by clicking the link [OneDrive] in each post.
  - If you are inside China, you can not access my notes by the link due to the internet restriction the government imposed on OneDrive. You can try following things,
    1. **(RECOMMENDED)** Find yourself a way to get over the restriction.
    2. Email me for the notes you are interested. Please specify who you are, what you are interested and your microsoft account in your email. I can give you access via email links. If I'm not replying, please email again. 
    3. **(NOT RECOMMENDED)** Find me in person.

  Those notes are accessible anytime anywhere on any devices, which means it can serve as a handbook for your study. I did find myself forgetting things I've learned quite often, but I never found Microsoft did. -->

- FOR CHEATSHEET
  
  Those are usually in pictures format with the source file being created by a cross-platform(`Windows`, `iOS`, `Android`) app *Concepts*. You can download the picture format to read or download the Concepts version to edit. Hope you find it helpful!

- FOR READING NOTES

  I've been doing some reading since 2019. I plan to apply for a ``Special Topics`` class in Georgia Tech on some of those topics.

# Reading Notes

## Concentration

- Reference book: *Concentration Inequalities, A Non-asymptotic Theory of Independence, S. Boucheron, etc.*
- My notes and my solutions to exercises in the book. (Updating...) [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwhJNrUuwAfkGqlTH_rQ)

# Statistics Class

## Linear model

- Lecturer: Vladimir Koltchinskii
- Institute: Georgia Institute of Technology
- Reference book: *Coordinate-free Approach to Linear Models, M. Wichura*
- Grade: Audit, not available
- Note Language: English

This was indeed a really good class, which set and firmed my current interest in statistics. I was lucky to have this class as my first class in statistics. [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgogKpsqlxwGQtEz7hg)

## Machine learning

- Lecturer: Deyu Meng
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lectured with His slides, but this is a good reference for the class. *Machine Learning, ZH Zhou*
- Grade: 93/A/4.0
- Cheatsheet Language: Chinese

I wasn't taking any notes since he was using slides. The cheat-sheets and summary(he covered way more contents than what's presented) are here,
- Summary [pdf](/CS/MachineLearning/content.pdf) [concepts](/CS/MachineLearning/content.concept)

## Stochastic process

- Lecturer: Lutz Warnke
- Institute: Georgia Institute of Technology
- Reference book: *Introduction to Probability model, S. Ross*
- Grade: A/4.0

Review contents and summary are here [pdf](/CS/DataAna/1.pdf) [concepts](CS/DataAna/1.concepts). The concepts version contains different layers which can be used as a self-test.

## Elements of financial statistics

- Lecturer: Yongchang Hui
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book:
- Grade: 87/A-/3.7

The English translation on my transcript for this class was The Elements of Financial Econometrics, which was the name of one of the books we used rather than the name of the class. 
I used an older student's notes, Yuji Lin who's now a graduate student at Xi'an Jiaotong University, as my review contents. I appreciate his help and support not only for this particular help, but also on offering many important information for my career. I'm not able to offer meaningful help to you, sorry for that. 


## Elements of biostatistics

- Lecturer: Limin Li
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: *Fundamentals of Biostatistics, Bernard Rosner* 
- Grade: 92/A/4.0
- Cheat-sheet Language: Chinese

I made notes on my textbook, which won't be available online due to copyright reasons.
The class also covered more contents than represented here. [pdf](CS/biostat/1.pdf) [concept](CS/biostat/1.concept)

# Mathematics Classes

## Stochastic calculus and brownian motion

- Lecturer: Michael Damron
- Institute: Georgia Institute of Technology
- Reference book: GTM274-*Brownian motion, Martingale and Stochastic Calculus, Le Gall*
- Grade: Audit, won't be available
- Note Language: English

Check out Michael's website for his great notes! [Math 7244](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~mdamron6/teaching/Fall_2019/Math_7244/index.html)
Mine expected to come soon.(in hand written form)

## Functional analysis

- Lecturer: Jiaqing Yang
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture notes
- Grade: 79 (Failed once, passed the compensate without curving.)
- Note Language: Chinese

[OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgolW_ObBhQy1HcnDjg)

Solid class on linear functional analysis, but it just happened. A great lesson for "If You don't care, you screw it up."

## Matrix analysis

- Lecturer: Feng Li
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: *矩阵论, 戴华*/*Matrix Theory, Hua Dai*, and *Matrix analysis, A Horn*

Contents are extremely useful in advanced research topics in advanced class and research in statistics! [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgakBPsWOsGR6vt5XxA)

## Optimization

- Lecturer: Hui Li
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture slides
- Grade 89/A-/3.7

Just 1 score distance to an A. I didn't take any notes on this class since he's using very well organized slides. The lecturer introduced way more content than presented in the review, with a lot of which are absolutely graduate level even cutting edge level. The review content are organized according to the requirements of the closed book final. [pdf](CS/opt/1.pdf) [concept](CS/opt/1.concept)

## Real analysis

- Lecturer: Lizhou Wang
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture notes
- Grade: 96/A/4.0
- Note Language: Chinese

This real analysis class was too elementary since it didn't cover $L^p$ space and many other important topics.[OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgah6w5kr7aP7h9JB0Q)

## Complex analysis

- Lecturer: Hongbin Chen
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: *Complex Analysis, E. Stein*
- Grade: 91/A/4.0
- Note Language: Chinese

The note is missing many important parts because I bought the book and switched to taking notes on the book for some while.[OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgah8y9gs0tZ3B-dsUw)

## Mathematical analysis

- Lecturer: Tian Li
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture notes
- Grade:
  1. 90/A
  2. 90/A
  3. 93/A
- Note Language: Chinese

Simply the best class I've ever taken in Xi'an Jiaotong University! My poor hand writing does not match up with it. [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwggSzfd1T_40d_XAy?e=vFwVNC)

## Advanced algebra

- Lecturer: Wei Wang
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture notes
- Grade:
  1. 80/B/3.0
  2. 79/B/3.0
- Note Language: Chinese

Solid class but notorious for its hard exams among the class of 2021, particularly the second term. Professor Wang did put a lot of efforts into it and it was an indeed solid class! I definitely could have done better. [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwigb__Toq9opu9Pza)

## ODE

- Lecturer: Zhandong Mei
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: A very bad one
- Grade: 79/B

<!-- This class was extremly poor in quality, I found it hard to activite any of my aspiration on taking notes or even going to the class. I felt the lecturer didn't care about the class nor prepared the contents. So I skipped most of classes and of course didn't take any notes. And because of my absence,  -->

I got a 79(B) for the final grade because of my abundance. I found the lecture completely a waste of time since the lecturer is just reading the textbook, and what make it even worse was that he seems to read it for the first time.
