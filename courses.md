This page contains parts of my notes in my study. Basically all of them are hand-writen digital notes. I tried and found it hard to keep my brain working while taking tex notes. I never enjoyed any reputation of good caligraphy. Be prepared when you read it. 

Majority of the notes are taken using *OneNote*, which is a free cross-platform(`Windows`, `macOS`, `iOS`, `Andriod`, `web`) note taking software developed by Microsoft. 

- If you are outside China, you can access my notes by clicking the link [OneDrive] in each post.

- If you are inside China, you can not access my notes by the link due to the internet restriction the government imposed on OneDrive. You can try following things,
  1. **(RECOMMENDED)** Find yourself a way to get over the restriction.
  2. Email me for the notes you are interested. Please specify who you are, what you are interested and your microsoft account in your email. I can give you access via email links. If I'm not replying, please email again. 
  3. **(NOT RECOMMENDED)** Find me in person.

Those notes are accessible anytime anywhere on any devices, which means it can serve as a handbook for your study. I did find myself forgetting things I've learned quite often, but I never found Microsoft did.


And there are also some cheatsheets I made for reviewing, which will be helpful if you are going to take the same class or you prefer some elementary knowledge summary. They are usually in pictures format with the source file being created by a cross-platform(`Windows`, `iOS`, `Andriod`) app *Concepts*. You can download the picture format to read or download the Concepts version to edit. 

# Advanced classes in probability and statistics

## Linear model

- Lecturer: Vladimir Koltchinskii
- Institute: Georgia Institute of Technology
- Reference book: Coordinate-free Approach to Linear Models *M. Wichura*
- Grade: Audit, not available
- Language: English

This was indeed a really good class, which basically set and firmed my interest in statistics. [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgogKpsqlxwGQtEz7hg)

## Stochastic calculus and brownian motion

- Lecturer: Michael Damron
- Institute: Georgia Institute of Technology
- Reference book: GTM274, Brownian motion, Martingale and Stochastic Calculus, *Le Gall*
- Grade: Audit, won't be available
- Language: English

Check out Michael's website for his great notes! [Math 7244](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~mdamron6/teaching/Fall_2019/Math_7244/index.html)

## Machine learning

- Lecturer: Deyu Meng
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lectured with His slides, but I learned this class by reading *Machine Learning, ZH Zhou*
- Grade: 93/A/4.0
- Language: Chinese

I wasn't taking any notes since he used slides. The review contents and summary(he covered way more contents than what's in herr) are here,

- Review [concepts](/CS/MachineLearning/review.concept)

# Elementary classes in probability and statistics

## Probability

- Lecturer: Qihong Duan
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: 概率论, *苏淳*/Probability theorem, *Chun Su*
- Grade: 96/A+/4.3
- Language: Chinese

Solid probability class! [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgatRW3r9LQ1shEr6_Q)

## Mathematical statistics

- Lecturer: Mayya Zhilova
- Institute: Georgia Institute of Technology
- Reference book: Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, *R. Hogg*
- Grade: A/4.0

Although the class has a reference book, the lecture notes are carefully organized and designed by Mayya! [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgfc3Ni8W4Vc9X9Q4Uw)

## Stochastic process

- Lecturer: Lutz Warnke
- Institute: Georgia Institute of Technology
- Reference book: Introduction to Probability model, *S. Ross*
- Grade: A/4.0

This class is too elementary since it wasn't measure theory based. However, it was a great class with a ton of examples. I am taking another class on continuous time random processes. [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgfdJwCJ3FxPtSRvTfQ)

## Data analysis and R

- Lecturer: Chunxia Zhang, Hongying Zhang
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: A very aged and outdated one, I learned this class by her slides and google.
- Grade: 97/A+/4.3
- Language: Chinese

Review contents and summary are here [pdf](/CS/DataAna/1.pdf)[concepts](CS/DataAna/1.concepts). The concepts version contains different layer which can be used as a self-test.

## Elements of financial statistics

- Lecturer: Yongchang Hui
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book:
- Grade:
- Language: Chinese


## Elements of biostatistics

- Lecturer: 
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book:
- Grade:
- Language: Chinese


# Elementary classes in mathematics

## Mathematical analysis(Chinese)

- Lecturer: Tian Li
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture notes
- Grade:
  1. 90/A
  2. 90/A
  3. 95/A+
- Language: Chinese

Simply the best class I've ever taken in Xi'an Jiaotong University! My poor hand writing does not match up with the contents. [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwggSzfd1T_40d_XAy?e=vFwVNC)

## Advanced algebra

- Lecturer: Wei Wang
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture notes
- Grade:
  1. 80/B/3.0
  2. 79/B/3.0
- Language: Chinese
This class was notorious for its hard exams among class of 2021. But professor Wang did put a lot of efforts into it. I definitely could have done better. I would consider my linear algebra as solid, since I've been working with it for quite a long time and taking several course like matrix analysis as supplementary. [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwigb__Toq9opu9Pza)

## Complex analysis

- Lecturer: Hongbin Chen
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Complex Analysis *E. Stein*
- Grade: 91/A/4.0
- Language: Chinese

The note is missing many important parts because I bought the book and switched to taking notes on the book for some while.[OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgah8y9gs0tZ3B-dsUw)

## Real analysis

- Lecturer: Lizhou Wang
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture notes
- Grade: 96/A+/4.3
- Language: Chinese

This real analysis class is too elementary since it didn't cover $L^p$ space and many other important topics.[OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgah6w5kr7aP7h9JB0Q)

## Functional analysis

- Lecturer: Jiaqing Yang
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: Lecture notes
- Grade: not availabel yet
- Language: Chinese

[OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgolW_ObBhQy1HcnDjg)


## Matrix analysis

- Lecturer: Feng Li
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: 矩阵论, *戴华*/Matrix Theory *Hua Dai*, and Matrix analysis *A Horn*
- Grades: 93/A/4.0

Solid class on improvements of linear algebra! [OneNote](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuAcaKqHRKbwgakBPsWOsGR6vt5XxA)

## ODE

- Lecturer: Zhandong Mei
- Institute: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Reference book: A very bad one
- Grade: 79/B

This class was extremly poor in quality, I find it hard to activite any of my aspiration on taking notes or even going to the class. I felt the lecturer didn't care about the class nor prepared the contents. So I skipped most of classes and of course didn't take any notes. And because of my absence, I got a 79(B) for the final grade.
